# NLP_SentimentClassification

For this project we are using the larger IMDB sentiment benchmark dataset from Stanford, an achieve close to state of the art results. It includes multiple models in ascending complexity, namely: 
1.TFIDF + classical statistical model (eg. RandomForest) 
2.LSTM classification model 
3.LSTM model, where the embeddings are initialized with pre-trained GloVe vectors 
4.fastText model 
5.BERT based model
